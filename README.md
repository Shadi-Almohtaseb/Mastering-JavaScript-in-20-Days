# Gaza Sky Geeks Learning Sprint - 20-Day Learning JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to the 20-Day Learning JavaScript Challenge! ðŸš€

In this challenge, I learned the basics of javascript and the best
practices for usingit during this challenge I dived into a lot of
exercises provided by FreeCodeCamp to be a master in Javascript.

## Daily Learning Process

1. Each day, I'm training for about 4 hours on the assigned courses listed above and doing some other exercises.
2. I have solved all the JavaScript coding challenges that will be provided by the GSG team and also not provided (113 exercises for the basis of javascript) and also the other exercises.
3. I summarized the daily learning and document challenge solutions on a separate readme page.
4. Then repeat this process for the next 20 days, gradually advancing my JavaScript skills.

- Commit to a consistent schedule and allocate sufficient time each day to complete the learning activities.
- Take notes, document my progress, and maintain a personal learning log throughout the challenge.
- Engage with the other GSG trainees. Seek support, share insights, and collaborate with fellow learners using the dedicated discussion telegram channel.
