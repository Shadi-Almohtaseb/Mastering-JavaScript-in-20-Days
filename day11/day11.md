# Day 11: Static Type and Scope

...

## Lesson Summary

- Strict mode is generated automatically in js and it make a special behavior.
- Strict mode example:
  ```javascript
  const fun = () => {
    title = "Welcome"; // reference error
    console.log(title);
  };
  ```
  - The code above reference an error deo to strict mode.
  - Undefined: means that it's declared but it's dose not have any value.
  - Declared: means that it's has never declared on the whole program.

```javascript
var teacher = "khaldoon"

function otherClass(){
    vat teacher = "shadi"
    console.log("Welcome")
}

function ask(){
    var = question = "why?";
    console.log(question)
}

otherClass()
ask()
```
